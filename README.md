# py_folio
A small python application to return values of held cryptocurrencies from coinmarketcap.

See example entries in coin.ini. Coins can either be added via their names or their codes (BTC, ETH, LTC, etc).

This application does not offer logging or graphing or anything; it simply returns the value of your holdings according to the values on coinmarketcap, in whichever currency you choose (as long as it's supported on the site) and also in BTC and ETH.
